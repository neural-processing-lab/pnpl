# Aloha to the PNPL library! üçç

PNPL is a friendly Python toolkit for loading and processing brain datasets for deep learning. It ships with ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse dataset classes (PyTorch `Dataset`) and simple utilities so you can focus on modeling, not file plumbing.

- [PyPI: `pnpl`](https://pypi.org/project/pnpl/)
- [GitHub: Neural-Processing-Lab/pnpl](https://github.com/neural-processing-lab/pnpl-public)


## Get Started

1) Install PNPL

```bash
pip install pnpl
```

2) Load a single run of LibriBrain Speech and iterate samples

```python
from pnpl.datasets.libribrain2025 import constants
from pnpl.datasets import LibriBrainSpeech

ds = LibriBrainSpeech(
    data_path="./data/LibriBrain",
    preprocessing_str="bads+headpos+sss+notch+bp+ds",
    include_run_keys=[constants.RUN_KEYS[0]]
    )
x, y, info = ds[0]
print(x.shape, y.shape)  # (channels,time), (time,)
```

## Future Plans
While currently the primary use of the PNPL library is for the 2025 LibriBrain competition (click [here](https://libribrain.com) to learn more!), we will maintain it for years to come and hope to turn it into a useful asset for the community. Among other things, that will mean adding:

- More public datasets and dataset loaders
- Easy-to-use preprocessing pipelines
- Data augmentation options
